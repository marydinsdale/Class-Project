This is an R Markdown document. I have no idea what I'm doing. 


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = "../")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message=FALSE)
library(ggplot2)
```

###Sometimes people ride their bikes on bridges!

```{r bike, echo=FALSE, include = F}
source("bike\ stuff.R")
```

```{r bikeplot, warning=F}
ggplot(data = bike) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = date, y = counts, color = name)) 

```

### R will let you make graphs that don't make sense
```{r bike2}
ggplot(data = bike) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = name, fill = dow), position = "fill")
```
